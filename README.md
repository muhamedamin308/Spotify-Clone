## Libraries and technologies used
- Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Exo Player Api : A media player is an app-level component that allows playback of video and audio files.
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Dagger Hilt Dependency Injection : to inject objects in Modules.
- Firebase Firestore : Database for the system.
- Firebase Storage : To store songs images and songs files.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
- Android MediaMetadata : Contains metadata about an item, such as the title, artist, etc.

## Progress
I am working on adding more features as Playlists, Shuffle playing mode and more UI improvments.
